Degree-1 equation = linear equation
System of Linear Equation: two or more linear equations
System doesn't have any solution: Inconsistent system >< Consistent system
Infinitely many solution => Consistent system
System flow: 
	500 = f1 + f2 + f3  --> 500 = f1 + f2 + f3
	f1 + f4 + f6  = 400 --> 400 = f1 + f4 + f6
	f2 = f5 + f4             --> 0      = f4 + f5 - f2
	f3 + f5  = 100 + f6 --> 100 = f3 + f5 - f6

- If there is a parameter then, that system has infinitely many solution
