### Sociological Perspective
```
People don’t do what they do because of inherited characteristics rather its external  influences (our experiences)  become part of our thinking and motivation.
	Charles Wright Mills - The Sociological Imagination
```

```
The ability to see the general in the particular and seeing the strange in the familiar
	Peter Berger
```

- *See the general in the particular*: Look at something that seems unique or isolated and then being able to recognize the larger features involved
	- Taking out the trash seems individual but everyone all does it
- *See the strange in the familiar*: look at the mundane everyday experiences with fresh eyes.

### Theory

> 	Theory: Explaination of something we see happening in the world.
- Not only answer what happened but also explain how and why. E.g: Charles Darwin not only describe but also give explanation of the Theory of Evolution.
- Common sense:  Eclectic blend of opinions and received wisdom that doesn’t always fit together in a consistent and coherent way. Imagine everyday theorizing >< formal research
