$$\sigma(w_1 * a_1 + w_2 * a_2 + \dots + w_n * a_n - b)$$

$\sigma$ : Sigmoid function or reLU
$w_1$ : Weighted of neuron
	Strength of a neuron  connection
$a_1$ : Activation  of neuron with lower layer
$b$ : Bias
	Tends to be active or inactive

- [[Cost function]] prevent from outputing bunch of possibility
	- Bad computer, only output 1 or 0
	- Cost function will turn the "utter trash" to only the 3 will be 1 and other one is 0
