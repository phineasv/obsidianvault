- Preprocess statements
	- Happens just before the compiler
	- `include` : Find a file, take all the content and paste in that file. They are typical [[Header file]]
- `main()` function
	- very important
	- entry point
	- code get excuted line by line
	- Return 0 if there is nothing `return` written
```cpp
cout << "Hello World";
cin.get(); //Waiting for ENTER
#The << works as a function. THey are overloaded operator
#Operator is function
```
- x86 -> Windows 32-bit
- Files get compiled individually by [[Compiler]] and turn into Object file (or obj file)
	- Object files = source files
- Linker takes obj files and glue them together
- Declaration: There is a function called ... and it exists
- Definition: This is WHAT that function is
