MEC - Mobile Edge Computing

- "Edge servers are deployed on Base Stations (BSs) --> provide high accessibility to nearby users, alleviating the computational burden of the remote cloud and significantly reducing network delays" (Tsipis & Oikonomou 2021)
	- Depend on server's service capacity and BS's communication radius

- Advantages for [[Multiplayer Cloud Gaming Service]]:
	- Shift the rendering task from cloud to edge (Gao, et al., 2022)
		- Players in the BSs zon can connect wirelssly to the edge servers --> access to the hosted gaming services -- > less delay (Tsipis & Oikonomou 2021)
	- Large coverage range (Gao, et al., 2022)
		- Serving for larger range of players
	- Flexible end-to-end communication in the edge of network --> easier achieve fairness (Gao, et al., 2022)

- Disadvantage (Gao, et al., 2022):
	- Limited resources
		- Hard to run on rresource-intensive video games
	- Player-to-server assignment --> low-delay interactivity and low-cost of system [[SIPA]] (Tsipis & Oikonomou 2021)

--> Combination of EC and Cloud Computing is efficient for good gaming experience and low cost (Gao, et al., 2022)
