- The cloud gaming model allows users (in this case the players) to offload their gaming demands and heavy computational tasks to the game servers of the cloud infrastructure (Tsipis & Oikonomou 2021)
	- Games are deployed on **cloud servers**
	- Access via thin clients with Internet connections (Gao, et al., 2022)

- Advantages: (Gao, et al., 2022)
	- Do not need to download or install game on local devices
	- Upgrade devices (Gao, et al., 2022)
	- [[Multiplayer Cloud Gaming Service]]

- Disadvantages: (Gao, et al., 2022)
	- Long response delay [[SIPA]]
		- Computing tasks are offloaded to remotoe cloud servers
	- poor game fairness 
		- player diversity --> long delay --> unfairness
	- high operational cost 
		- Service build and maintain large num of cloud datacenters

- Long distances between the players and the cloud game servers + Bottlenecks created by the competition for game resources --> network overhead

- As  a result, [[MEC]] pushes computing power in close proximity to the players  --> **Alleviating** **central cloud game infrastructure** -->  **better resource management** (Tsipis & Oikonomou 2021)
