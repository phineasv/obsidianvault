- Distributed interactive applications

- Interactivity is crucial (Tsipis & Oikonomou)

- 3 - step performances: 
	- player *p* make a new game operation to server *s*
	- *s* forwards operation to *s'* --> *s'* performs computations
	- *s'* sends result to *p'* (Tsipis & Oikonomou)

* Minimizing the sum of pairwise interaction delays (Tsipis & Oikonomou)

- Problem is basically player-to-server
	- [[SIPA]] (Social Interactivity-based Player Assignment) problem
